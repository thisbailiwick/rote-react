This is a personal project to learn React/Redux.

It's a text editor geared towards helping you memorize a piece of text by, you guessed it, rote. You can copy in a piece of text, click the start button and you're shown a blank text editor. You can then begin typing your piece into the text editor and the editor will highlight misspelled text as you are typing. A rough non React/Redux version of the concept is [available](http://rote.thisbailiwick.com).
